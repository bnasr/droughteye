<h2>Drought Eye: Monitoring Thermal Stress in Near Real-time</h2>
<p>Monitoring drought in real-time using minimal field data is a key task for ecosystem management and conservation. We demonstrated how the space-borne canopy ''thermal stres'', defined as surface-air temperature difference, provides a reliable surrogate for drought-induced water stress in vegetation.</p>

<p>We quantified monthly thermal stress anomalies based on remotely sensed surface temperature from <a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod11.php">MODIS Land Surface Temperature</a> and air temperature from <a href="http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/">PRISM</a>. Percent tree cover data are obtained from <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-land-cover-database-nlcd-land-cover-collection">The National Land Cover Database (NLCD)</a>. Physiographic regions boundaries are collected from <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/physiographic-divisions-of-the-conterminous-u-s">U.S. Geological Survey</a>. The interface allows for real-time monitoring of thermal stress as the data become available. Monthly rasters are also available for download through the interface. Bulk downloads may be available upon request.</p>
