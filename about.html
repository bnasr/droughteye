<h2>Drought Eye: Monitoring thermal stress in near real-time</h2>
<p>Monitoring drought in real-time using minimal field data is a key task for ecosystem management and conservation. However, most methods require extensive data collection and in-situ calibration, or monitoring accuracy is still unknown across scales. We demonstrated how the space-borne canopy ''thermal stres'', defined as surface-air temperature difference, provides a reliable surrogate for drought-induced water stress in vegetation.</p>

<p>Here, we quantified monthly thermal stress anomalies based on remotely sensed surface temperature from MODIS and air temperature from PRISM. The interface allows for real-time monitoring of thermal stress as the data become available. Monthly rasters are also available for download through the interface. Bulk download may be available upon request.</p>
