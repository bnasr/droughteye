## Drought Eye: Monitoring Thermal Stress in Near Real-time

Monitoring drought in real-time using minimal field data is a key task for ecosystem management and conservation. We demonstrated how the space-borne canopy ''thermal stres'', defined as surface-air temperature difference, provides a reliable surrogate for drought-induced water stress in vegetation.

We quantified monthly thermal stress anomalies based on remotely sensed surface temperature from [MODIS Land Surface Temperature](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod11.php) and air temperature from [PRISM](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/). Percent tree cover data are obtained from [The National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-land-cover-database-nlcd-land-cover-collection). Physiographic regions boundaries are collected from [U.S. Geological Survey](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/physiographic-divisions-of-the-conterminous-u-s). The interface allows for real-time monitoring of thermal stress as the data become available. Monthly rasters are also available for download through the interface. Bulk downloads may be available upon request.
